WHAT IS IMIQ?

The Imiq Hydroclimate database houses hydrologic, climatologic, and soils
data collected in Alaska and Western Canada from the early 1900s to the present.
This database unifies and preserves numerous data collections that have,
until now, been stored in field notebooks, on desktop computers, as well as
in disparate databases.  Synthesizing and analyzing the large-scale hydroclimate
characteristics of this important climatic region have been made easier with this
searchable database.

The Imiq Data Portal provides public access to portions of the Imiq
Hydroclimate Database through a simple web interface with search and
visualization options. Data and metadata are easily downloaded in a common
file format and have been normalized into common units.  The Imiq Data
Portal has been designed to meet the needs of land stewards, resource
managers, and scientific researchers.

The word Imiq means 'freshwater' in the Inupiat language of Northern Alaska.

DATA QUALITY ASSURANCE/QUALITY CONTROL

Data have not been subjected to QA/QC after receipt from the source, except for
broad, variable-specific thresholds. Data may have been altered from their
original form as part of normalization into the database and any data flagged
by their source as questionable were omitted. Please examine the documentation
automatically downloaded with the data and use data at your own risk.

HOW TO CITE THE DATA

Please cite both the data originator and the Imiq Data Portal.  In many cases,
data may be changed from their original units or averaged across time periods.
The metadata pertaining to the originator will be downloaded with the data.  The
Imiq Data Portal should be cited as:

PROJECT PARTNERS

Construction of the Imiq Hydroclimate Database and the Imiq Data Portal
was funded by the Arctic Landscape Conservation Cooperative (LCC) and
the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. Continued development of the Imiq Database
and Data Portal is funded by the Arctic LCC, the North Slope Science Initiative,
and the U.S. National Park Service.  Project work has been performed by
The University of Alaska Fairbanks/Geographic Information Network of Alaska
(UAF/GINA). Data were contributed from many agencies and investigator-driven
research projects.
