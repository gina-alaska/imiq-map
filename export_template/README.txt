Background: The Imiq database is a central repository containing hydrology and 
climate-related data in Alaska and nearby regions and was built by researchers 
at the University of Alaska Fairbanks. The word Imiq means ‘freshwater’ in the 
Inupiat language of Northern Alaska.

Project Partners: Construction of the Imiq Database was funded by the Arctic 
Landscape Conservation Cooperative (LCC) and the U.S. Fish and Wildlife 
Service. Development of the Imiq Data Portal was funded by the Arctic LCC and 
the North Slope Science Initiative, and implemented by the Geographic 
Information Network of Alaska (GINA). Data were contributed and collected from many 
agencies and investigator-driven research projects.
