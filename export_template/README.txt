BACKGROUND

The Imiq Hydroclimate Database houses hydrologic, climatologic, and soils 
data collected in Alaska and Western Canada from the early 1900s to the present. 

The Imiq Data Portal provides public access to the Imiq Hydroclimate 
Database through a simple web interface with search and visualization options. 
Data and metadata are easily downloaded in a common file format and have been 
normalized into common units.

The word Imiq means ‘freshwater’ in the Inupiat language of Northern Alaska.

Please cite both the data originator and the Imiq Data Portal.  In many cases,
